The file should be downloaded and opened using Jyputer Notebook. The training data used is a collection of png files, where each file is filled with the same letter in different fonts and in both uppercase and lowercase. You will need to have these stored on a google drive in order to run the training stage. (You will be prompted to mount your google drive in the first cell of the ipynb file.)
