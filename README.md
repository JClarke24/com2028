# README

This coursework concerns the automated recognition of letters and words with the help of AI techniques.

The file should be downloaded and opened using Jyputer Notebook. The training data used is a collection of png files, where each file is filled with the same letter in different fonts and in both uppercase and lowercase. You will need to have these stored on a google drive in order to run the training stage. (You will be prompted to mount your google drive in the first cell of the ipynb file.)
